tortunnel is a partial Onion Proxy implementation that's designed to build single-hop circuits through Tor exit nodes. This is useful in cases where you might want some very low level of anonymity and don't want to deal with the performance implications of using Tor's full three-hop circuits.

tortunnel exposes itself both as a SOCKS interface, as well as a fairly clean asynchronous C++ API to the Tor protocol itself. It was first written as a scanning tool for checking to see whether exit nodes were running sslstrip, and is well suited for implementing other high-performance scanning routines against the Tor network as a whole.
